Absolute or relative detection efficiency calibration of germanium detectors in ROOT

Add in your own data and ,for an absolute efficiency curve, your calibration source info!

Run in the command line with: grsisort -l RootEffi.C

grsisort -l

.x RootEffi.C

Also, the above 'grsisort' can be replaced with 'root' - and it should work just fine!
